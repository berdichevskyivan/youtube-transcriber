ASKING FOR WORK AND DON'T HE STARTED ON THOSE WHO TREAT LING DINLIC A DATING END NO CAD PLEASE NO NO LINGDON IS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT WINKDON BOAST OVER A BILLION MEMBERS IN TWO HUNDRED COUNTRIES WORLD IDE MAKING IT AN AMAZING VENU TO BUILD AN STRENGTHEND A REAL PROFESSIONAL NETWORK BUT ERIC I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BUILD A NETWORK IT TAKES TOO LORD YOU'RE WRONG TO DAY I'VE BROUGHT ON ANDREW HERMEN A REACINLY HIRED JUNIOR SOFOR GINEER WHO NEVER APPLIED TO A JOB BUT GOT HIRED ANYWAY BEFORE HE EVEN GRA ADUATED FROM HIS BOO CAMP BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS HE BUILT ON LINKED IN SO LET'S HEAR OW HE USED LINKED IN TO MAKE IT HAPPEN ALL RIGHT ANDREW SO A LOT OF NEW DEVELOPERS SPEND MOST OF THER IME BULK APPLYING TO JOBS BUT YOU DID SOMETHING LITTL DIFFERENT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT ALL THE WORK YOU PUT INTO YOUR LINKED IN AND HOW THAT PLATE OUT FOR YOU YE UN MY STRAEGY TO GET A JOB WEVE ETTER NOT WAS NOT REALLY TO APPLY TO A LOT OF JOBS I WAS TRYING TO YOU'S NOT WORK GING AND LINK AN AH

NOW CAN BRING THAT O THE ABLE AS AS A DIFFERENT IATOR SO THE S FAR AS THIS OPPORTUNE IT IDENTIFICATION II WANT TO KEEP TALKING BOUT E VERY LASE STEPS YER THAT'S ALL RIGHT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE MOST ONERS I WORK WITH AT GETTING THE INTERVIEW RIGHT IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE THE BEHAVI ROLE A THE CULTURE AFFAIR NOT EVEN THE TECHNAL INTER OU IS JUST GETTING THE FIRST INTERVIEW IS THAT THE B YOU STRUGGLE AT SO IDENTIFYING THIS COMPANY AND AT YOU ARE IDENTIFYING S PECIFICALLY COMPANIES THAT HAD TO OVERLAP WITH YOUR FINANCE EXPERIENCE HOW DID YOU FIND THOSE LIKE UNMISTHINKING U GUGUL FINANCE ER FINTA ECK

PERSONG AWIEL T ANSWER THAT QUESTION BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE LIKE WHAT TYPE OF COMPANIES SIR THEY HAVE RELEVANT INTERISOR EXTRENCIM R I I LIKE I LIKE THE FOCUS ON YOU BEING THE ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF LIKE YOU ARE FINING THESE COMPANIES CAUSE THE N ULGES AN YOU TO GO FIND WHAT YOU THINK WOULDBE THE BEST OR A LAUGH BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE OR A LO EYE ON THE BOO CAMP THE KIND OF DU A LOT OF THAT ADVOCACY FOR THEM YOU WAN THEY DON'T START NETWORKING NTILL VERY LATE AND THEN TOO THAT RELY ON THE CAREER SERVICE AYS OF THAT BOO CAMP TOO YOU DON'T FIND THEM WORK WHEN A LEASTIN THE CURRENT
